By using the Site, you consent to the use of your user information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.  If you are located in the EU, you will also be asked to provide clear and unequivocal affirmative consent to the collection, processing, and sharing of your user information via cookies and similar technologies.  The Site is owned and operated by Forbes. \r\n\r\nNotice to EU Individuals: this Privacy Statement and its enumerated policies are intended to comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (the “General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) and provide appropriate protection and care with respect to the treatment of your user information in accordance with the GDPR.  \r\n\r\n<h4>Summary</h4>\r\n\r\nTo enhance, personalize, and support your experience on the Site, among other things, we collect, use, and share your user information.  For example, we use aggregated information to develop content targeted to user interests and to generally improve the Site’s user experience.  As detailed below, your user information may also be used by Forbes and its partners to tailor content and ads, provide social media features (e.g., features that allow you to share content directly to your preferred social media platform), track your preferences, analyze traffic, and provide similar services and content.  Forbes is committed to your privacy and will not share any user information with any third party without your consent, except as outlined in this Privacy Statement or as permitted by law.  If you have any requests, comments, or questions about this Privacy Statement or your user information, please contact us in the manner provided below.\r\n\r\n<h4>What this Privacy Statement Covers</h4>\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Statement covers the Site. While you may encounter links on the Site to other websites, such as those relating to our third party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners, please note that these websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement (unless otherwise noted on such site, which may be the case if, for example, the site is also owned and operated by Forbes). \r\n\r\nThis Privacy Statement does not apply to the activities of Forbes third party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners that may collect your user information while accessing or using such third party’s services in connection with your use of our Site (e.g. social media and sharing services).  The privacy and information practices of those third parties are not covered by this Privacy Statement.  To learn more about such third party policies, we encourage you to read and review the privacy statements of each third party service that you may choose to use in connection with the Site. This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected by us. \r\n\r\nAs a general reminder, please think carefully before you decide to put anything on the internet.  For example, if you voluntarily disclose user information in chat areas or bulletin boards (e.g., comments sections), that information could be seen and used by others, and may result in unsolicited messages from others. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information or other user information you may choose to submit in these public forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove personal information voluntarily disclosed by you in such forums for legal retention purposes or technical limitations (e.g., the data may not be searchable), in which case, we will notify you if we are unable to do so. \r\n\r\n<h3>Gathering of Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<b>Section Overview:</b> We collect user information when you use the Site.  Sometimes you may submit it to us yourself, other times it may be collected automatically.  You can manage and change your preferences as outlined below.\r\n\r\n<h4>Information Collected</h4>\r\n\r\nWhen you use the Site, your user information may be collected, used, and shared in a variety of manners.  As detailed below, the type of user information collected may vary based on how it was gathered, but may include, among other things, your name, email address, and other information that you voluntarily submit (e.g., when setting up an account or submitting a registration or application on the Site, you may submit your contact information, social media account handles, and/or professional information), information automatically collected about your usage of the Site (e.g., the content that you choose to view), and information about you that our third party partners may share with us if such third party partners have previously received your consent to do so.     \r\n\r\n<h4>Voluntary Submission</h4>\r\n \r\nForbes may collect user information that is voluntarily provided by you or with your permission.  For example, we may ask you for information, such as your e-mail address, when you register to become a member of the Site or register for a Forbes-produced live event. You may also provide information to Forbes in other contexts, including, for example, on your member profile page and public profile URL, to enter into a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion, or to apply for consideration in connection with a Forbes list or similar accolade (e.g., Under 30 list applications). In the event you order something from the Site or one of our co-branded websites, we may request additional personal information, such as your address, telephone number and credit card information, in order to complete the purchase. You always have the option not to provide the information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services. When you register or become a member of the Site or provide information to Forbes in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. We also supplement the data you provide to us with data from data append services such as public or social graph data in order to better serve you with content or promotions.\r\n\r\n<h4>Cookies</h4>\r\n\r\nA cookie is a small data file that is written to your computer's hard drive by your web browser. A cookie file can contain and/or automatically collect information, such as a user identification code or IP address, that a website will use to track the pages and number of times you have visited.  The data read from these cookies may be linked to personally identifying (PII) and non-personally identifying (non-PII) information. \r\n\r\nWe and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on the Site to personalize and optimize your browsing experience and the Site by:\r\n<ul><li>providing you tailored content and advertisements (see below for more information), </li>\r\n\t<li>enabling social media features, </li>\r\n\t<li>safeguarding against spam and malware,</li>\r\n\t<li>analyzing trends, traffic, and user behavior, </li>\r\n\t<li>administering the website, </li>\r\n\t<li>gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole,</li>\r\n\t<li>tracking web and advertising analytics throughout the Site and its affiliate websites,</li>\r\n\t<li>remembering your preferences and voluntarily-submitted information (e.g. custom video playlists, preferences, job title, story ratings, membership status),</li>\r\n\t<li>performing location-related functionalities and analytics,</li>\r\n\t<li>participating in market research (e.g., website ratings), and</li>\r\n\t<li>educating ourselves about how we can continue to improve the Site and its various elements.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nCookies fall into the subcategories below.\r\n\r\nEssential Cookies.  Certain cookies are used for specific purposes that are essential to your secure use and navigation of the Site.  Without them, Forbes may not be able to provide core Site functions and features to you, and the Site would not operate as well as you or Forbes would like.  These cookies collect and use information such as your server preferences, single-session data and corresponding identifier, web beacons and log files (detailed below), and other credential-related information.  For EU individuals, essential cookies also help inform Forbes whether you require, or have already been served, an affirmative consent request in connection with the GDPR.  Essential cookies include analytics cookies, which provide us data that allows Forbes to better understand its users and improve the Site based on what we have learned from that data.\r\n\r\nPreference Cookies.  Other cookies are used to collect and process information about your preferences and similar choices in connection with the Site in order to optimize your browsing experience (e.g., various local preference settings; which geographically-customized version of the Site and related content you may prefer [e.g., Forbes US, Forbes Asia, Forbes Europe]).  Preference cookies include social media cookies, which collect information about your social media usage and other data you may have provided in connection with such usage (if you access the Site through a social media website or mobile application, you may have social media cookies).  If you wish to modify or change your social media cookies, please visit and review the settings on your applicable social media account(s).\r\n\r\nAdvertising Cookies.  To help support the Site and further tailor your experience, Forbes and its advertising partners (and/or their third party analytics providers) also use cookies on the Site to personalize the content and advertisements you may be shown.  Such advertisements use cookies to provide you targeted advertisements that may be more consistent with your interests than non-targeted advertisements.  Certain Forbes advertising partners may also use cookies to monitor or track the performance of their advertising content, including native advertising content (e.g., BrandVoice).  Forbes does not provide user information to advertising partners except in connection with the Site or as required by law.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to manage your cookie preferences or learn more information about this practice and your right to decline (or opt-out of) cookies placed by some or all of these companies, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/\">click here</a>. \r\n\r\nWe encourage you to consider keeping your cookies enabled, as if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our Site, you may not be able to use or benefit from certain features of the Site, particularly the features that are designed to personalize your experience.  To learn more about the use of cookies in online advertising including how to manage or delete them <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options\">click here</a>.\r\n\r\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but generally allow users to modify their browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, to accept cookies only from certain websites, and/or to refuse all cookies.\r\n\r\n<h4>Web Beacons</h4>\r\n\r\nWe use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users, assess traffic patterns, identify preferred content and measure site engagement. We also include web beacons in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened.\r\n\r\nForbes and its partners (including advertising partners) also use web beacons to collect various data provided by your browser while you are on our Site and elsewhere (i.e., outside of the Site) where we may be acting as a 3rd party. This data is collected in the aggregate, but may include or be associated with other non-PII or PII that users have voluntarily submitted.\r\n\r\n<h4>Log Files</h4>\r\n\r\nThe Site’s web and ad servers log information about a user's IP address, browser type and the current URL the user is requesting. This information is always provided by a user's browser and automatically logged by most websites. These log files are stored in a secure location and used in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our website.\r\n\r\n<h3>Use of Your Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<b>Section Overview:</b> Our primary goal in collecting, using, and sharing user information is to enhance your experience on the Site, support the Site, and improve its features, performance, and other elements.  Your user information may be used for the purposes outlined below.  We will not use your user information without a valid legal basis to do so.\r\n\r\n<h4>To Target Content and Advertising</h4>\r\n\r\nTo develop and provide content and advertising to you that is targeted to your interests, we use the analytics collected by the systems described above to determine which areas of our website you prefer based upon the frequency of your visits and engagement with those areas. We may make reasonable assumptions based on your browser provided data to target relevant content and advertising to you on our site and elsewhere where we may be acting as a 3rd party. We may also make reasonable geographic and demographic assumptions based on your presented IP address to target relevant content and advertising.\r\n\r\n<h4>To Provide Interactive Communications from the Site</h4>\r\n\r\nTo enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications, such as notifications of activity by topic or contributor to the e-mail address that you provide to us. Such interactive communications are provided only to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive them as part of their user profile.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time we may provide e-mails highlighting new features, promotions or contests on the website to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile.\r\n\r\n<h4>To Provide Communications from Third Parties</h4>\r\n\r\nWe respect the privacy of our users and will not disclose or distribute our user list to any third party, nor will we permit anyone else to do so. However, we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive third party offers as part of their user profile. In those cases, your e-mail address will be transferred to the third party.  You can remove your consent to this use or modify your related user information by contacting Forbes as indicated below.\r\n\r\n<h4>Sharing of Information</h4>\r\n\r\nYou may be requested to voluntarily provide certain user information during your use of the Site.  If you choose to do so, that user information may be shared with Forbes as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Forbes.\r\n\r\nWe use third parties to provide credit card processing, e-mail service providers and hosting services on the Site. When you sign up for such services, we will share your user information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your user information for any other purpose.  With respect to credit card processing, we do not collect, store, or process any credit card information.  If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service. \r\n\r\nIn addition, if you provide any personally identifiable information via an advertiser promotion, please be aware you are directly providing your personally identifiable information to that advertiser.\r\n\r\nFrom time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you, such as your name and e-mail. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this personally identifiable information to notify contest winners and award prizes.\r\n\r\nWe may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, you can log in to our site using sign-in services that bridge your social media login information with the Site. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. These services give you the option to post information about your activities on this website to your profile page to share with others within your network.  The Site includes social media features, widgets and/or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features are small content modules that users can embed on sites and may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, or set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.\r\n\r\nWe offer widgets that are hosted on the Site, like our embeddable video player. Use of the Forbes.com widgets is subject to the Site <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/terms\">terms of use</a>, but downloading or embedding these widgets on other websites is not covered by this privacy statement.\r\n\r\n<h4>Aggregate Information with Advertisers</h4>\r\n\r\nForbes derives the majority of its revenue on the Site from advertising and sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users. In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.\r\n\r\nWe partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out or modify your choices by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/\">clicking here</a>, or if located in the European Union by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/\">clicking here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.\r\n\r\n<h4>As Necessary to Provide Services to You</h4>\r\n\r\nWe occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of newsletter mailings, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service. In some instances, these companies may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the external service provider. In all cases, these companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n<h4>In the Event of Sale or Bankruptcy</h4>\r\n\r\nThe ownership of the Site may change at some point in the future.
