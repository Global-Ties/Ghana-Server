<h3><strong><a name="collection"></a>Cookies: What information about you do we collect and how do we use it?</strong></h3>
<p>By accessing the Sites or using the Services, you may provide to us two types of information: (1) personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information; and (2) non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of technologies such as &ldquo;cookies,&rdquo; &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo; or &ldquo;web logs.&rdquo;&nbsp; We use the information we collect to monitor and analyze how the Sites and the Services are used, to provide customer service, and to maintain and improve the Sites and the Services. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your mobile device.</p>
<p>You may be asked to submit personally-identifiable information to access or use certain aspects of the Services offered on the Sites &ndash; for example, when you create an account, subscribe to our mailing list, make a donation, contact us, receive customer or technical support, participate in chat rooms, forums, polls, questionnaires, surveys or promotions.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Asset Transfers</strong>. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or other transaction involving the sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy, the information, including personally-identifiable information, collected from you through your use of the Sites may be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable measures to notify you, either through e-mail or a prominent notice on the Sites.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may share your personally-identifiable information with the service providers that we engage in connection with the Sites or the Services.

You should carefully review the Official Rules of each promotion in which you choose to participate through the Sites, as the Official Rules may contain additional important information about a third party&rsquo;s collection and use of your information. To the extent that the Official Rules of any promotion conflict with this Policy, the Official Rules will govern collection and use of your personally-identifiable information in conjunction with that particular promotion.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose to join one of our mobile marketing lists, please be aware that there are usually costs associated with receiving SMS or MMS messages, which are determined by your carrier. You should contact your carrier to determine the charges that may apply, before you sign up to receive our updates via SMS or MMS. </strong>If you wish to stop receiving such messages from us, at any time, simply write &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; in a reply to any message from us.</p>
<p>You agree that, in the event that any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Policy or our privacy practices, you will attempt to negotiate, in good faith, a written resolution of your dispute or claim directly with us and/or our affiliates or subsidiaries, depending on your concern. You agree that if your dispute or claim remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via Certified Mail or personal delivery) that a dispute or claim exists, the parties shall join in mediation services in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee, with a mutually chosen mediator, in an attempt to resolve the dispute or claim. Should you file any arbitration claims, any administrative actions, or any court actions without first having attempted to resolve your dispute or claim by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover any costs of the proceeding, including, without limitation, your attorneys&rsquo; fees or other costs, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="tracking"></a>What is our policy on tracking?</strong></h3>
<p>We do not participate in tracking networks and do not intentionally or knowingly allow other parties to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, when you visit the Sites or use any of the Services.</p>
<p>You may be able to adjust your browser&rsquo;s setting to turn on a &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; feature. We support &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; and will honor a relevant &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signal. However, because there is no uniform standard for &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signal recognition, the Sites may not respond to all types of &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="security"></a>What security measures do we take?</strong></h3>
<p>The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us is stored on servers that are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to personally-identifiable information to our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Sites and the Services. However, <strong>no data transmission over the Internet or through mobile telecommunications can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and, for this reason, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us or that is transmitted to us as a result of your use of the Sites or any of the Services. </strong>You can help protect your personally-identifiable information by using strong passwords, changing your password often, using a secure web browser, and signing off and closing your web browser when you are finished with the use of the Sites.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="international"></a>Does this policy apply outside of the United States?</strong></h3>
<p>We comply with United States privacy laws and regulations. We do not represent that the Sites are governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of other nations, or that the Sites or the Services are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. If you choose to access the Sites or the Services, you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. By using any part of the Sites or the Services, visitors to the Sites from outside the United States acknowledge and agree that the Sites are subject to the United States laws and regulations, and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.</p>
