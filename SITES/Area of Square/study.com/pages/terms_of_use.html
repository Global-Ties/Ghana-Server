		 <p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEMBERSHIP</strong></p>
		 
		 <p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership Term. Any person with a User Account is a Member. Your membership starts when you create a User Account and will continue
			 unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it pursuant to these Terms of Service. You must provide us with a current, valid
			 and accepted method of payment (&quot;Payment Method&quot;) to use the Services as a User Account-holding member. You agree to provide accurate,
			 current and complete information during the registration process and to keep it accurate, current and complete. You represent and warrant that
			 you are authorized to use such Payment Method for purchases. We will bill the applicable membership fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel
			 your membership before it renews each month or year as applicable in order to avoid billing of the next billing period to your Payment Method.</p>
		 
		 <p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership Levels. We may offer a number of membership plans, including special promotional plans or memberships with differing
			 conditions and limitations, any of which may be subject to Additional Terms. You can find specific details regarding your membership by
			 visiting our Site and following the &quot;My Dashboard&quot; link. Some promotional memberships may be offered by third parties in conjunction

			 any changed terms prior to continuing to use the Site or Services, and if you do not do so, you will not be permitted to continue to use the

			 associated membership immediately if you fail to verify your teacher status on a timely basis. By successfully maintaining the teacher membership,
			 you are authorized to publicly display the Site, Services, or Content for educational purposes only.  For example, as a teacher, you may display
			 the Site, Services, or Content in a group setting such as a classroom, tutoring center or school lab without our express written consent and
			 transmit or distribute the lessons to your students using the Site functionality as provided.</p>
	
		 <p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FREE TRIALS</strong></p>
		 
		 <p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trial Period.  We may offer a free trial for a particular membership plan when you create a User Account with us. The free trial period
			 of your membership lasts for one day or as other duration specified during User Account sign-up (&quot;Trial Period&quot;).  Free trials may
			 not be combined with any other offers. Free trials are for new and certain former members only. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion,
			 to determine your free trial eligibility. If you are eligible for a free trial, we will let you know during the User Account sign-up process,
			 and you will be able to explore the Site and Services during the Trial Period for no charge. Only one Trial Period is permitted per User Account.
			 If you receive a trial, then you are not eligible for another trial.  You acknowledge and agree that your access to and use of the Services
			 during the Trial Period are governed by these Terms of Service.  If you participate in the free trial, the terms in the following two paragraphs
			 apply to you.</p>
		 
		 <p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorization.  We will automatically begin billing your Payment Method at the end of the Trial Period unless you expressly cancel
			 the membership prior to the end of the Trial Period. To view the specific details of your trial membership, including full membership pricing
			 and selected membership plans, visit the &quot;My Dashboard&quot; page on the Site.  We may bill your Payment Method for a billing period selected by
			 you (e.g., monthly, annually, etc.) for temporary authorization at the time of the registration process. In some instances, your available
			 balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect such temporary authorization amount during the Trial Period.</p>
		 
		 <p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End of Trial Period.  We have no obligation to notify you of the end of the Trial Period, and you will not receive a notice from us
			 that your Trial Period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun. You hereby acknowledge and agree that it is your
			 sole responsibility to cancel your membership subscription prior to the end of the Trial Period and that not cancelling your trial membership
			 subscription prior to the end of the Trial Period will result in your first payment for the term of your subscription, as well as subsequent
			 recurring charges until you cancel your membership.</p>

        <p><strong>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BILLING</strong></p>

        <p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the Services will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each
			  month or year thereafter (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;) depending on your selected billing terms unless and until you cancel your membership. We
			  automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership
			  (&quot;Renewal Date&quot;). All fees and applicable taxes are payable in United States dollars. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment.
			  We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled.
			  In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable
			  month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your
			  next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your Renewal Date is subject to change
			  due to changes in your membership. Visit the &quot;My Dashboard&quot; page on the Site to see the commencement date for your next Renewal Date.
			  We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Service, &quot;billing&quot;
			  means a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method.</p>

        <p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurring Billing. By starting your membership, you authorize us to charge you a monthly or annual membership fee depending on your
			  Billing Cycle at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Services to your Payment Method.
			  You acknowledge that the amount billed for each Billing Cycle may vary for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional
			  offers and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed
			  in one or more charges.</p>

        <p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for any part of the Services in any manner and at any time as we may determine
			  in our sole and absolute discretion. Any price changes that correspond to the completion of a promotional offer and/or changing or adding a
			  plan will take effect on the Renewal Date without any prior notice to you from us. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms
			  of Service, any other price changes to your Services will take effect following email notice to you or an announcement on the Site.</p>

        <p>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions and Redemption Codes.  We may offer a promotion, contest or coupon code that will provide a discount or extended Trial
			  Period on your membership subscription. These redemption codes may only be redeemed at the Site.  Redemption codes are non-transferable,
			  may only be used once and cannot be combined with other codes or redeemed for cash. The validity of redemption codes may depend on the
			  status of the member who redeems it. For example, an existing subscriber may not redeem a code providing a discount for a new subscription.
			  Redemption codes may have an expiration date, after which time the code will not be valid or accepted by the Site. Redemption codes are
			  provided for your use only, and you agree that you will not share any redemption codes with others, including by emailing codes to friends
			  or family, sharing codes on social networking sites, or posting codes to third party websites that are not our Site unless we provide written
			  approval via email or on our Site to do so. We may terminate any promotions and invalidate unused redemption codes in our sole discretion.
			  A discount provided via a redemption code is only valid during your paid subscription. If you cancel your subscription, you also cancel the
			  discount from the redemption code. Reactivating your subscription will not reactivate the discount from the redemption code; nor will it
			  allow you to redeem a code for a discount for new subscribers. If you receive a promotion code through an offer from a third party, additional
			  restrictions may apply.</p>

        <p>v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Refunds. No refunds will be given in any circumstances. At any time and for any reason, however, we may provide credits, discounts,
			  or other considerations to some or all of our members (&quot;Membership Credits&quot;). The amount and form of such Membership Credits,
			  and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of Membership Credits in one instance does not
			  entitle you to Membership Credits in the future for similar instances; nor does it obligate us to provide Membership Credits in the future,
			  under any circumstance. One such reason for Membership Credit may be if you upgrade or downgrade your membership plan. You may receive a
			  pro-rated Membership Credit or charge, as applicable, of the previously paid monthly or annual fee for the remaining days of that month or
			  year, to be applied against the new subscription amount to be charged to your Payment Method on your Renewal Date.</p>

        <p>vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting the &quot;My Dashboard&quot; page available at the Site.
			  If a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information
			  or cancel your account (see &quot;Cancellation&quot; below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue
			  billing the Payment Method. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. If you signed up for the Services using your account
			  with a third party (e.g., Facebook, PayPal, iTunes, or similar account) as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your membership with us,
			  including during your Trial Period, please follow the instructions from such third party (e.g., visiting your account with the applicable
			  third party and turning off auto-renew for, or unsubscribing from, our Services). You may also find billing information about your membership
			  by visiting your account with the applicable third party. </p>

        <p>vii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation. You may cancel your membership at any time by visiting the &quot;My Dashboard&quot; page on the Site.  After cancelling
			  your membership, you will continue to have access to the Services through the end of your Billing Cycle. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR MEMBERSHIP
			  CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH OR PARTIAL-YEAR MEMBERSHIP PERIODS, UNWATCHED LESSONS OR UNUSED MEMBERSHIPS.</p>

        <h3 id="mandatoryArbitration">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory Arbitration</h3>

        <p>You agree and understand that this Section is deemed to be a &quot;written agreement to arbitrate&quot; pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
			  Act, satisfies the &quot;writing&quot; requirement of that act, applies to your use of the Site or the Services, and governs all claims,
			  disputes, or controversies between you and Study.com and Study.com Parties, including but not limited to tort and contract claims, claims
			  based upon any federal, state, or local statute, law, order, ordinance, or regulation, and claims over the applicability of this arbitration
			  provision (collectively &quot;Claims&quot;).  This Section can only be changed or terminated upon mutual agreement.</p>

        <p>You understand and agree that all Claims shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration using the American Arbitration Association's
			  (&quot;AAA&quot;) Commercial Arbitration Rules (&quot;AAA Rules&quot;) in effect on the date of initiation of the arbitration, except as to
			  those AAA Rules that conflict with or differ from these Terms of Service, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said rules
			  at a location within Santa Clara County, California. Any controversy concerning whether a dispute is arbitral shall be determined by the
			  arbitrator(s) and not by the court.  In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms of Service
			  (including any Additional Terms) and may award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees). However, WITH
			  ARBITRATION: (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY
			  RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.</p>

        <p>Each party to the arbitration will have the right, at its own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of its own choosing.
			  You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but, if
			  applicable arbitration rules or laws require Study.com to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to
			  be enforceable, then Study.com will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator's decision
			  must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential
			  findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may
			  be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
	
		 <p><strong>NO CLASS ACTION MATTERS.  </strong>You agree that disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated
			 with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party, such as class claims or private
			 attorney general representative actions, with the exception of representative claims solely for injunctive relief brought under California
			 unfair competition law.  If any provision of this arbitration provision is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision shall be
			 severable from the remainder of this paragraph, which shall remain fully enforceable.  AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO
			 PURSUE YOUR CLAIM FOR ALLEGED DAMAGES ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

			 FOR: (a)  PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS

		 <p>THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE AND
			 REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE OR STUDY.COM WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT

			 TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE MOBILE APP OR YOUR POSSESSION AND/OR USE OF THE MOBILE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, (I) PRODUCT
			 LIABILITY CLAIMS; (II) ANY CLAIM THAT THE MOBILE APP FAILS TO CONFORM TO ANY APPLICABLE LEGAL OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENT; AND (III) CLAIMS
			 ARISING UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION OR SIMILAR LEGISLATION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT AS PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS.</p>
	
		 <p><strong>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p>
		 
		 <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Study.com, its affiliates, providers, or its and their respective officers, directors,
			 partners, shareholders, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, service providers, advertisers, instructors, staff, successors
			 or assigns (&quot;Study.com Parties&quot;) from and against all and any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs,
			 expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to your use or misuse of the Mobile App, your breach of
			 this EULA, or your noncompliance with law.</p>
	
		 <p><strong>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANDATORY ARBITRATION</strong></p>
		 
		 <p>You agree and understand that this Section is deemed to be a &quot;written agreement to arbitrate&quot; pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
			 Act, satisfies the &quot;writing&quot; requirement of that act, applies to your use of the Mobile App, and governs all claims, disputes,
			 or controversies between you and Study.com and each and all Study.com Parties, including but not limited to tort and contract claims, claims
			 based upon any federal, state, or local statute, law, order, ordinance, or regulation, and claims over the applicability of this arbitration
			 provision (collectively &quot;Claims&quot;).  This Section can only be changed or terminated upon mutual agreement.</p>
		 
		 <p>You understand and agree that all Claims shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration using the American Arbitration Association's
			 (&quot;AAA&quot;) Commercial Arbitration Rules (&quot;AAA Rules&quot;) in effect on the date of initiation of the arbitration, except as to
			 those AAA Rules that conflict with or differ from this EULA, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said rules at a location
			 within Santa Clara County, California. Any controversy concerning whether a dispute is arbitral shall be determined by the arbitrator(s) and
			 not by the court.  In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this EULA and may award the prevailing party damages
			 and other relief (including attorneys' fees).</p>
		 
		 <p>However, WITH ARBITRATION: (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
			 CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.</p>
		 
		 <p>Each party to the arbitration will have the right, at its own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of its own choosing.
			 You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but,
			 if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Study.com to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section
			 to be enforceable, then Study.com will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator's decision
			 must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings
			 and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered
			 in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
		 
		 <p>NO CLASS ACTION MATTERS.  You agree that disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other
			 arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party, such as class claims or private attorney general
			 representative actions, with the exception of representative claims solely for injunctive relief brought under California unfair competition
			 law.  If any provision of this arbitration provision is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision shall be severable from the
			 remainder of this paragraph, which shall remain fully enforceable.  AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM
			 FOR ALLEGED DAMAGES ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.  </p>
	
		 <p><strong>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALIFORNIA LAW AND JURISDICTION</strong></p>
		 
		 <p>All disputes arising out of or related to the use of the Mobile App, as permitted following the mandatory arbitration described above, shall
			 be brought in the state or federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive
			 jurisdiction and venue thereof. This EULA will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict
			 of law principles.</p>
	
		 <p><strong>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEVERABILITY; WAIVER</strong></p>
		 
		 <p>If, for any reason, a tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of this EULA to be unenforceable, the
			 remainder of this EULA will continue in full force and effect.  Any waiver of any provision of this EULA will be effective only if in writing
			 and signed by or on behalf of Study.com.</p>
	
		 <p><strong>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENTIRE AGREEMENT/THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES</strong></p>
		 
		 <p>This EULA constitutes the entire and only agreement between the parties in relation to its subject matter and replaces and extinguishes all
			 prior or simultaneous agreements, undertakings, arrangements, understandings or statements of any nature made by the parties or any of them
			 whether oral or written (and, if written, whether or not in draft form) with respect to such subject matter. Each of the parties acknowledge
			 that they are not relying on any statements, warranties or representations given or made by any of them in relation to the subject matter
			 of this EULA, save those expressly set out in this EULA, and that they shall have no rights or remedies with respect to such subject matter
			 otherwise than under this EULA save to the extent that they arise out of the fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation of another party. No
			 variation of this EULA shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by or on behalf of Study.com.  If you use the Mobile App on a
			 Mobile Device running iOS, Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this EULA and may enforce this EULA against you as a
			 third party beneficiary. Subject to such right of Apple to enforce this EULA as a third party beneficiary, a person who is not a party to this
			 EULA has no right under any applicable law to enforce any term of this EULA. </p>

        <h3>Honor Code for Students</h3>
        <h3>Online Courses</h3>
		 
		 <p>When using a Study.com Online Course, you must make sure that: (a) your answers to homework, quizzes and exams will be your own work (except
			 for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration); (b) you will not make solutions to homework, quizzes or exams available to anyone else
			 (including both solutions written by you and any official solutions provided by us); and (c) you will not engage in any other activities that
			 will dishonestly improve your results or dishonestly improve or hurt the results of others.</p>
	
		 <h3>Instant Answers</h3>
		 
		 <p>To make sure you get the most out of Instant Answers, we want to help you understand what it is for and how to use it. Follow our instructions
			 to obtain the answers you need while also exercising academic honesty. When submitting questions to Instant Answers, please:</p>
    
		 <ul>
			 <li>Don't use Instant Answers to do your homework (or write your essay) for you. We're here to help you study and understand concepts you're
				 struggling with. We can answer your questions and direct you to lessons that you'll find useful, but you agree not to simply copy and paste
				 the answers we give you.</li>
			 <li>Don't write one-word questions. Make sure you're giving our instructors enough detail and context so that they can provide a meaningful
				 response.</li>
			 <li>Don't put multiple questions in one submission. Each question should be submitted in its own ticket so we can deliver your questions to
				 the correct subject matter experts.</li>
			 <li>Don't use Instant Answers in any way that violates the rules of your assignment, classroom, or academic institution. This would include
				 plagiarizing or using outside help when you're instructed not to.</li>
		 </ul>
		 
        <h3>Cheating</h3>

        <p>We all know that cheating is bad, and there are a lot of reasons not to cheat! Let's look at a few of them:</p>
		 
		 <ul>
			 <li>First, the person who is the most hurt when you cheat is you. Seriously! Cheating on your homework means that you won't learn the material,
				 which will hurt you in your current class and in the future. Homework and essays are a great way to learn and think about the material,
				 and cheating will only hurt you in the long run.</li>
			 <li>Second, all teachers and academic institutions take cheating seriously. If you're caught cheating on your homework or plagiarizing your
				 answers or essay from another source, you will likely face serious consequences. In some cases, you might just receive a zero on the assignment,
				 but in others, plagiarism can result in an automatic failure in your class, or maybe even expulsion from your school depending on the
				 academic honesty policy in place.</li>
			 <li>Third, now more than ever, it's really easy to get caught for cheating! Copying answers from a page on the internet might seem like a
				 quick way to complete your homework, but it's just as easy for your teacher to find those exact phrases with a simple Internet search.
				 It's important for you to think about the information you're reading and phrase it in your own words, rather than simply copying from
				 outside sources.</li>
