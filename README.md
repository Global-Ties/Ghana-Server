HOW TO RUN:
npm install (ONLY FIRST BOOT UP - SETS UP FILES AND LIBRARIES)
nodemon Crawler2.js
google-chrome index.html

Things to download (NOT COMPREHENSIVE):
node
npm
nodemon



NOTES for further development:

***Need to implement refresh mechanics, httrack commands, file management***

starting, stopping, and restarting apache server
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 <start, stop, restart>

Running RESTful API's with Nodejs servers (useful for paths/urls + file
management)
